# Logo Maker

## Description
This program allows a user to create a customized logo generated based upon user input. This program was created in order to eliminate the need for a graphic designer to create a logo, allowing a freelance developer to quickly create a customized logo for any project.

## Usage
A walkthrough video on how to use this Node.js application can be found at https://youtu.be/rDHQdX7Ut3Q. 

In order to launch this application, use the node index command from the GitBash terminal with Node.js installed. The program will prompt the user for a logo shape color, and logo text color, a shape for the logo, and text to include in the logo. Once the user has entered all data, the program will generate a custom svg formatted logo for the user to utilize.
